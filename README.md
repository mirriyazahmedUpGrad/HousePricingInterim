# Project Name
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

How well those variables describe the price of a house.
Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

Business Goal

You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

Solution Approach

EDA and Data Preparation
Model building with Ridge and Lasso to identify optimal alpha (Linear Regression is intentionally avoided as problem statement specifies Regularization)
Identifying the most significant predictors for the optimal alpha

## General Information

Below is the approach followed for arriving and evaluating the linear regression model

1.	Getting data ready and understanding data
a.	Reading, understanding/visualizing
b.	Checking and cleaning up data (missing values, nulls, etc.)
c.	Evaluating and preparing data (dropping redundant cols, using appropriate categorical variables and dummy variables; with modification where needed); 
d.	Applying EDA principles (finding relation between data using univariate, bivariate analysis)
e.	
2.	Building the model



## Conclusions
Unable to complete the model on time due to errors faced.
